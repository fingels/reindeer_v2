# Roadmap / Whishlist / To Do List
- Performance benchmark
- Adapt to GGCAT and connect with KMTricks
- Serialisation unordered_map (cereal library) ?
- Instead of adding files one by one sequentially, use a divide and conquer method. Parallelizable. Needs to implement merge structures.
- Queries that excludes some files
- Add CMake
